If I want the simulation and the towns to be more complex
  then I have to implement place-ownership






Each building will have an owner (the one that builds it)

The door of a building can be passed just by the owner of it.





what happens to forlon buildings?
  how about taxes
  if you leave town you can pay upfront for the time you are going to leave
  if you don't pay the goverment will send somebody to break into your house to sell the items and sell the house
  el loco que cobra los taxes podria dejar una carta en la pueta como advertencia de que no se esta pagando






Only the owner of a storage will be able to enter it, and he is supposed to stand n the door wating for customers that come to sell or to buy things.
  Or also the customers can go to the storage (or blacksmith or whatever) and knock the door



Units will have a mental map of different storages
where they store:
  item price
  item abundance

They also have a score of "security", this score is 1 if the unit immediately visited the storage
  and decreasess over time



Units tend to visit those stores that have low score, to see if there is something new 







List of steps to acheive this:
each building has an owner
only the owner build the building
units can not pass doors that are not theirs
the map of scores
units sometimes spend some time in their work places (storages or blacksmith or whatever)
buyers go to shops if they see the owner in the entrance, and increase their score
buyers go and buy things
