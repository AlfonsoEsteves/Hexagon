at the beginning each unit is his own leader
  and units can be converted

units usually get converted by offerings or by threats

each unit remembers a friendly rate towards the groups it encounters
  if the rate is low, they fight
  if it is high, they ignore or trade
  if it is low, they can warn each other not to get closer

rates can be increased by giving offerings
