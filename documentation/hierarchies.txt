at the beginning each unit is his own leader
  and units can be converted

units usually get converted by offerings or by threats

each unit remembers a friendly rate towards the groups it encounters
  if the rate is low, they fight
  if it is high, they ignore or trade
  if it is low, they can warn each other not to get closer

rates can be increased by giving offerings








more specifically:
  this rate indicates:
     'how much should group X trust in me'

 that is because if a unit A gives a tres to other B
   then not only B should respect A, but also the nearby units of that group




after a unit gain or loses this rate
  where it goes back to its base ans interacts with its allies, it shares partially its rates with them (the rates get averaged)


communications:
  ask offering / threat
  offer something so someone joins
  
others:
  ask to trade

si 2 unidades sin bando se cruzon
  si una tiene un bien, se lo ofrece a la otra para que se le una
  si A tiene bando y B no
    si B no deberia ser confiado por A, entonces o B ofrece una ofrenda o se una, o pelean
    si si, no pasa nada
  si ambos tienen bandos distintos
    o alguno da una ofrenda o se pelean
