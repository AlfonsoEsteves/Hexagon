across all the map, there is going to be hell gates


from a hell gate different types of demons come out, and try to kill the units, and their buildings



demons constantly lose life as they dwell in the surface of the world
  that is why it is not a good idea to surround a hell gate with defenses (you would be fighting against full life demons)



for the time being, I intends to make all the units allies. They will spread across the map just to get ore resources.





hell gates will have different sizes/intensities








IDEA:
  some demons will fly others no


flying demons can stand over walls and roofs, but they can not steal or attack something beneath a roof
