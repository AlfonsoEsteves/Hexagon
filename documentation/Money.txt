Persons are created with 0 money
They will have to sell something to start having money
  This makes sense, because at the beginning depots also start without items to sell.

Depots don't have a money variable
  They can buy infinite amount of things

PRICE REGULATION FOR PERSONS
If the lack the item the price increase
If they have to much of the same item the price goes down

PRICE REGULATION FOR DEPOTS
If somebody buys an item the price goes up
If somebody sells an item the price goes down

But, what happens in the opposite case?
  The person that does not buy becasuse the price is too high
  The person that does not sell because the price is too low

The first is easy, the depot can detect that and decrease the price.

The seconds is more tricky, because it could lead to an item having a ridiculously big price.

But I guess this favours traders, so I will leave like that.
